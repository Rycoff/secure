# Secure

This is a simple project I've made for fun and to test my knowledge in python. This project give the user the ability to decrypt a hash, generate a password and test its strength.

## Features

- Hash Decrypter = Decrypt a specific hash
- Password Generator = Generate a password of choice
- Password Strength Checker = Test the strength of your password/s
- SSH Brute Forcer = Brute Force an SSH, a password file is included just for exemple but you can use whatever password file you want
- Email Collector = Scan a website and collect all emails from it. Make sure to copy paste an url. 

## How it works

### Hash Decrypter

The available hashes here's: md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384 and sha512

You can either generate a own password list or search on google for the most common password and use that list to see if your can crack the hash with that password file.

### Password Generator

This generate a password at random and let you include both numbers and special characters. You decide how many letters, numbers and special charachters you want to use for the password.

### Password Strength Checker

With this checker you can see how strong your password is.

### SSH Brute Forcer

Here you can try to brute force an SSH, a password list is included but feel free to use your own or another word list.
